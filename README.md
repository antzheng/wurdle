# Wurdle: The Word Guessing Game

An adaptation of the popular [word game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), recreated in Svelte and now with extra modes!

- **GUESS THE WORD:** This is the daily word puzzle that will keep you guessing! Try to figure out today's word in six tries or less!

- **ACCESSIBILITY:** Inspired by Josh Wardle's [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), play the game in dark mode or high contrast mode!

- **GAME MODES:** Like the original, but with more modes! Play the **4-letter,** **5-letter,** and **6-letter** modes to keep the fun going!

**Disclaimer:** I created this spinoff because I wanted to learn and use Svelte for the first time. This is not affiliated with the popular word game of similar name. Please support the original [here!](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)
